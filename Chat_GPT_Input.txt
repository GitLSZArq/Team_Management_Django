I am planning to start a new interface that is very user friendly and very beautiful to use. I have Python installed on my PC, if it's easy to do in Python, let's go for that, if not, u guide me how to do it.

The goal is to do the following :

1. It's an interface for Team Management
2. I want to make multiple sections that are all connected to each others : 
	a. Section "People" : It's the list of all the people in the team as well as information about them
	b. Section "Project" : 
		i. List of projects in progess
		ii. The project has a unique name	
		iii. The project has a unique code
		iv. it needs to containe a list of tasks that can increase manually by any team member
		v. Each task is associated to a team member
		vi. Each task has a date of start, a desired day of end and a real date of end
		vii. each task has a % of progress as well as a visual bar linked to that %
	c. Section dedicated to the simulations
		i. It is similar to the projects but it's dedicated for simulation activites
		ii. It needs to have all the same paramters as a project

I repeat, i need it to be visually appealing to use, make it maybe like bubble interfaces , something very nice to use, i don't want a boring interface.
If u have very nice ideas, propose them.

So please save this as the plan, and let's start step by step

cd desktop/team_management

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py runserver --verbosity 3


npm install -g serve
serve -s build

npm run build
npm start
